Ok, let's make sure that the printer is ON. When a printer is ON, it should have some light or LED (usually green) indicating it's recieving power. If you do not have any indicator light, make sure the printer is connected to a working power outlet by verifying each end of the power cable. Next press the printer power button. Is the printer powered ON?

Ok, then it can't be the power problem. Let's check the cartridge. Without paper, your printer will not be able to print. Make sure you have the paper loaded into the paper printer cartridge or tray. Next, verify that no paper printer is jammed or partially fed into the printer. If you suspect paper is stuck somewhere, it should be removed.

Ok. Finally, I recommend you to restart your system. Begin by restarting your software application. If that doesn't work, reboot your computer. Lastly turn off your printer for a few minutes before switiching it back ON. Did I solve your issue?
