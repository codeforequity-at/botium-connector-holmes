Let's check if you're using the right printer for printing. Please select one of the options to
proceed


#me
I am using right printer

Ok, let's make sure that the printer is ON. When a printer is ON, it should have some light or
LED (usually green) indicating it's receiving power.
 If you do not have any indicator light, make sure the printer is connected to a working power
outlet by verifying each end of the power cable. Next press the printer power button.
 Is the printer powered ON?


#me
yes

#bot
Ok, then it can't be the power problem. Let's check the cartridge.

 Without paper, your printer will not be able to print. Make sure you have the paper loaded into
the paper printer cartridge or tray.

 Next, verify that no paper printer is jammed or partially fed into the printer. If you suspect paper
is stuck somewhere, it should be removed.


#me
Paper is not jammed or stuck

#bot
Ok. Finally, I recommend you restart your system.
 Begin by restarting your software application. If that doesn't work, reboot your computer. Lastly
turn off your printer for a few minutes before switching it back ON.
 Did I solve your issue?

#me
yes
